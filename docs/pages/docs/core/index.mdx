# AI Core (experimental)

The Vercel AI SDK offers a unified way of calling large language models (LLMs) that can be used with any compatible provider:

- `generateText`: Generate text and call tools
- `streamText`: Stream text and call tools
- `generateObject`: Generate a structured object that matches a schema
- `streamObject`: Stream a structured object that matches a schema

## Language Model Interface

Providers need to provide an implementation of the language model interface to be compatible with the AI SDK.
We provide implementations for:

- OpenAI (`ai/openai`)
- Mistral (`ai/mistral`)
