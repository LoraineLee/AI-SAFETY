# Contributing to the Vercel AI SDK

We deeply appreciate your interest in contributing to our repository! Whether you're reporting bugs, suggesting enhancements, improving docs, or submitting pull requests, your contributions help improve the project for everyone.

## Reporting Bugs

If you've encountered a bug in the project, we encourage you to report it to us. Please follow these steps:

1. **Check the Issue Tracker**: Before submitting a new bug report, please check our issue tracker to see if the bug has already been reported. If it has, you can add to the existing report.
2. **Create a New Issue**: If the bug hasn't been reported, create a new issue. Provide a clear title and a detailed description of the bug. Include any relevant logs, error messages, and steps to reproduce the issue.
3. **Label Your Issue**: If possible, label your issue as a `bug` so it's easier for maintainers to identify.

## Suggesting Enhancements

We're always looking for suggestions to make our project better. If you have an idea for an enhancement, please:

1. **Check the Issue Tracker**: Similar to bug reports, please check if someone else has already suggested the enhancement. If so, feel free to add your thoughts to the existing issue.
2. **Create a New Issue**: If your enhancement hasn't been suggested yet, create a new issue. Provide a detailed description of your suggested enhancement and how it would benefit the project.

## Improving Docs

Documentation is crucial for understanding and using our project effectively.
You can find the content of our docs under `content`.
If you see areas for improvement or want to correct errors:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Make a copy of the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Make Your Changes**: Edit the documentation files where you see opportunities for improvement or correction.
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Once you've made your improvements, submit a pull request to the main repository with your changes.

To fix smaller typos, you can also edit the code directly in GitHub or use Github.dev (press `.` in Github).

## Submitting Pull Requests

Your pull requests are welcome. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, improving documentation, or correcting typos, here's how to submit them:

1. **Fork the Repository**: If you haven't already, make a copy of the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a New Branch**: Work on your changes in a new branch. Ideally, name the branch in a way that reflects the changes you're making.
3. **Commit Your Changes**: Make sure your commits are clear and concise, describing what has been changed and why.
4. **Open a Pull Request**: Submit your changes for review. Provide a clear title and description of your contributions. Link any relevant issues your PR addresses.
