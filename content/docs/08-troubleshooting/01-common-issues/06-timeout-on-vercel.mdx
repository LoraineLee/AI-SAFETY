# Getting Timeouts When Deploying on Vercel

## Issue

Streaming with the AI SDK works in my local dev environment.
I'm using the app router and I'm deploying to Vercel.
However, I'm getting timeouts.

## Solution

Add the following to your route file:

```tsx
export const maxDuration = 60;
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

This will enforce dynamic behavior, which is required for streaming.
