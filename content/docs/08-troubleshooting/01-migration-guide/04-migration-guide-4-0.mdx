# Migrate AI SDK 3.3 to 4.0

<Note type="warning">
  AI SDK 4.0 has not been released yet. It is currently a canary version and
  there will be more breaking changes. We will update this guide as we make
  progress.
</Note>

## Breaking Changes

### Removed Svelte, Vue, and SolidJS exports

The `ai` package no longer exports Svelte, Vue, and SolidJS UI integrations.
You need to install the `@ai-sdk/svelte`, `@ai-sdk/vue`, and `@ai-sdk/solid` packages directly.

```ts filename="AI SDK 3.3"
import { useChat } from 'ai/svelte';
```

```ts filename="AI SDK 4.0"
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/svelte';
```
