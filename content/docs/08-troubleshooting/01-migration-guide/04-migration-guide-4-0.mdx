# Migrate AI SDK 3.3 to 4.0

<Note type="warning">
  AI SDK 4.0 has not been released yet. It is currently a canary version and
  there will be more breaking changes. We will update this guide as we make
  progress.
</Note>

## Recommended Process

1. [migrate to AI SDK 3.3](/docs/08-troubleshooting/migration-guide/migration-guide-3-3).
2. Resolve all deprecation warnings.
3. Upgrade to AI SDK 4.0 and follow the breaking changes guide below.

## Breaking Changes

You need to install the `@ai-sdk/svelte`, `@ai-sdk/vue`, and `@ai-sdk/solid` packages directly.

```ts filename="AI SDK 3.3"
import { useChat } from 'ai/svelte';
```

```ts filename="AI SDK 4.0"
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/svelte';
```

The AI SDK RSC 3.0 `render` function has been removed.
Please use the `streamUI` function instead or switch to AI SDK UI.
