# `OpenAIStream`

Transforms the response from OpenAI's language models into a ReadableStream.

Note: Prior to v4, the official OpenAI API SDK does not support the Edge Runtime and only works in serverless environments. The openai-edge package is based on fetch instead of axios (and thus works in the Edge Runtime) so we recommend using openai v4+ or openai-edge.

## Import

### React

<Snippet text={`import { OpenAIStream } from "ai"`} prompt={false} />

<ReferenceTable packageName="streams" functionName="OpenAIStream" />
