# `InkeepStream`

The InkeepStream function is a utility that transforms the output from [Inkeep](https://inkeep.com)'s API into a ReadableStream. It uses AIStream under the hood, applying a specific parser for the Inkeep's response data structure.

This works with the official Inkeep API, and it's supported in both Node.js, the Edge Runtime, and browser environments.

## Import

### React

<Snippet text={`import { InkeepStream } from "ai"`} prompt={false} />
