# Telemetry

<Note type="warning">
  This feature is experimental and may change in the future. Currently, only the
  `generateText` and `streamText` functions support telemetry.
</Note>

The Vercel AI SDK uses [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to collect telemetry data.
OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework designed to provide
standardized instrumentation for collecting telemetry data.

## Enabling telemetry

For Next.js applications, please follow the [Next.js OpenTelemetry guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/open-telemetry) to enable telemetry first.

You can then use the `experimental_telemetry` option to enable telemetry on specific function calls while
the feature is experimental.
