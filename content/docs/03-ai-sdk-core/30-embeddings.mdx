# Embeddings

Embeddings are a way to represent words, phrases, or images as vectors in a high-dimensional space.
In this space, similar words are close to each other, and the distance between words can be used to measure their similarity.

## Embedding a Single Value

The Vercel AI SDK provides the `embed` function to embed single values, which is useful for tasks such as finding similar words
or phrases or clustering text. You can use it with embeddings models, e.g. `openai.embedding('text-embedding-3-large')` or `mistral.embedding('mistral-embed')`.

```tsx
import { embed } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: openai.embedding('text-embedding-3-small'),
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
});
```
