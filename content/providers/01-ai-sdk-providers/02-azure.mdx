# Azure OpenAI Provider

The [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service) provider contains language model support for the Azure OpenAI chat API.

## Setup

The Azure OpenAI provider is available in the `@ai-sdk/azure` module. You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="pnpm install @ai-sdk/azure" dark />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/azure" dark />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/azure" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `azure` from `@ai-sdk/azure`:

```ts
import { azure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createAzure` from `@ai-sdk/azure` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createAzure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';

const azure = createAzure({
  resourceName: 'your-resource-name', // Azure resource name
  apiKey: 'your-api-key',
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the OpenAI provider instance:

- **resourceName** _string_

  Azure resource name.
  It defaults to the `AZURE_RESOURCE_NAME` environment variable.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being send using the `api-key` header.
  It defaults to the `AZURE_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Language Models

The Azure OpenAI provider instance is a function that you can invoke to create a language model:

```ts
const model = azure('your-deployment-name');
```

You need to pass your deployment name as the first argument.

### Example

You can use OpenAI language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { azure } from '@ai-sdk/azure';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: azure('your-deployment-name'),
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

OpenAI language models can also be used in the `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`, and `streamUI` functions
(see [AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core) and [AI SDK RSC](/docs/ai-sdk-rsc)).

Azure OpenAI chat models support also some model specific settings that are not part of the [standard call settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings).
You can pass them as an options argument:

```ts
const model = azure('your-deployment-name', {
  logitBias: {
    // optional likelihood for specific tokens
    '50256': -100,
  },
  user: 'test-user', // optional unique user identifier
});
```

The following optional settings are available for OpenAI chat models:

- **logitBias** _Record&lt;number, number&gt;_

  Modifies the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

  Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in
  the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You
  can use this tokenizer tool to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically,
  the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling.
  The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should
  decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100
  should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

  As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the token from being generated.

- **logProbs** _boolean | number_

  Return the log probabilities of the tokens. Including logprobs will increase
  the response size and can slow down response times. However, it can
  be useful to better understand how the model is behaving.

  Setting to true will return the log probabilities of the tokens that
  were generated.

  Setting to a number will return the log probabilities of the top n
  tokens that were generated.

- **user** _string_

  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to
  monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.
