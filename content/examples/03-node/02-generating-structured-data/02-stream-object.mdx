# Stream Object Generation

Object generation can sometimes take a long time to complete, especially when you're generating a large schema.
In such cases, it is useful to stream the object to the client in real-time.
This allows the client to display the object as it is being generated,
rather than have users wait for it to complete before displaying the result.

```ts file='index.ts'
import { streamObject } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = await streamObject({
  model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
  maxTokens: 2000,
  schema: z.object({
    characters: z.array(
      z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        class: z
          .string()
          .describe('Character class, e.g. warrior, mage, or thief.'),
        description: z.string(),
      }),
    ),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate 3 character descriptions for a fantasy role playing game.',
});

for await (const partialObject of result.partialObjectStream) {
  console.clear();
  console.log(partialObject);
}
```
