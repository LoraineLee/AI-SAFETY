# Call Functions in Parallel

Some language models support calling tools in parallel. This is particularly useful when multiple functions are independent of each other and can be executed in parallel during the same generation step.

```ts file='index.ts'
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
  tools: {
    weather: {
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      parameters: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }: { location: string }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    },
    cityAttractions: {
      parameters: z.object({ city: z.string() }),
      execute: async ({ city }: { city: string }) => {
        if (city === 'San Francisco') {
          return {
            attractions: [
              'Golden Gate Bridge',
              'Alcatraz Island',
              "Fisherman's Wharf",
            ],
          };
        } else {
          return { attractions: [] };
        }
      },
    },
  },
  prompt:
    'What is the weather in San Francisco and what attractions should I visit?',
});

console.log(result);
```
