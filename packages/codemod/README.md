# AI SDK Codemods

The AI SDK provides Codemod transformations to help upgrade your codebase when a feature is deprecated, removed, or otherwise changed.

Codemods are transformations that run on your codebase programmatically. They allow you to easily apply many changes without having to manually go through every file.

You can run an individual codemod via:

```sh
npx @ai-sdk/codemod <transform> <path>
```
